# CS686-Project-Classifying-Types-of-Cars-using-CNN
This project trains three different models of Convolutional neural networks and uses the models to classify different types of cars given car images as inputs. It requires the following librarys: numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, skimage, keras, and tensorflow. To run this code, please have Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook installed along with the requried libraries. Then run the code using Jupyter Notebook. The outputs of the code are the plots of accuracy of the CNN models displayed on the Jupyter Notebook Interface.  

This project uses Piquin's open-source code for most parts of the CNN algorithm. The original project can be viewed on https://www.kaggle.com/pierrenicolaspiquin/classifying-art-pieces/data.
